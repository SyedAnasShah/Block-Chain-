# Simple command line program for digital currency wallet. 
This System is based on Node.js
For Api i used cryptocompare freeversion.
I have divided the whole task into 2 parts.

1. Main Function

    In Main Function i used switches becauses i have to perform 4 operations based on user preferences. When i run any option it will from 100s to 120s due to limited resorces of my machine and no of data in CSV file.

I have used following node modules to perform the task:

1.1: CSV Parser

1.2: FS

1.3: Readline

1.4: Request

2. Helper Function


To Run this on local machine use following command:
1. cd /Project-folder
2. npm install
3. node main
